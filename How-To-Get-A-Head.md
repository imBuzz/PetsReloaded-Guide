# Appling a head skin to an Item

Hi! In order to apply a skin head to an item, you have to go on this website: [Minecraft Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com/).
After this you have to search the head you want, and copy the value on the section "other" and paste it on the section "skull" in the items part of pets.
